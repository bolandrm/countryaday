# Country a Day
CountryaDay.org is a simple web app that gives you a different country to learn about each day.  It provides some introductory information from various web services as a basis for you to begin learning about your country of the day.

## Services & Libraries
Country A Day wouldn't have been possible without the following awesome services and libraries:
- [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) - Country summary paragraphs
- [Feedzilla](http://feedzilla.com) - Countries "in the news"
- [Geonames](http://geonames.org) - Additional Country info
- [JVectorMap](http://jvectormap.com)
- Angularjs
- Everything in my [Gemfile](Gemfile)

## Known Issues
1. Countries featured are incomplete or inaccurate.  At some point these should be standardized to countries recognized by the UN or something like that. In the intrest of saving some time, I took the default world map from the J Vector Map library.
